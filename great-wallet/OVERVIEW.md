# Great Wallet

> ⚠️ **PROOF OF CONCEPT — NOT SAFE FOR USE.** The current Great Wall
> implementation is a **substandard proof of concept**: it does not yet match the
> finalized protocol specification and has not undergone independent security
> review. **Do not use it to protect real Bitcoin, funds, or any secret of
> value.** This notice will be removed once the implementation is brought up to
> the specified protocol.

**Remember your Bitcoin — carry nothing.**

Great Wallet is a self-custody Bitcoin wallet whose seed lives only in
your memory, protected by a fractal that is easy for *you* to recall
and prohibitively expensive for anyone else to search. Nothing to
steal, nothing to seize, nothing to lose in a fire.

> It's all in your head, in nobody else's, the attacker is aware of
> that, and is nevertheless unable to rob it.

## Documentation and Dependencies

The authoritative specification, invariants, and development guide live in
the vendored `great-wall-docs` submodule (repo:
[`yuri-svb/great-wall-docs`](https://github.com/yuri-svb/great-wall-docs)):

- [`great-wall-docs/great-wallet/ARCHITECTURE.md`](great-wall-docs/great-wallet/ARCHITECTURE.md)
  — ecosystem-wide context
- [`great-wall-docs/great-wallet/THREAT_MODEL.md`](great-wall-docs/great-wallet/THREAT_MODEL.md)
  — technical description of the threat model the protocol aims at defending against
- [`great-wall-docs/justification-and-economics/JUSTIFICATION.{tex/pdf}`](great-wall-docs/justification-and-economics/JUSTIFICATION.pdf)
  — in-depth, quantitative analysis on the economics of problem and proposed solution

Clone with submodules:

```
git clone --recursive <url>
# or, to avoid redundant recursion of great-wall-docs:
git submodule update --init # without the flag --recursive
```

## The four properties

Great Wallet gives you four guarantees at the same time:

1. **Knowledge-Based Authentication.** Your secret lives entirely in
   your memory. No device, physical vault, or geographic location is
   required to access your funds.
2. **Individual Custody.** You depend on no one else. The core
   premise of Bitcoin — full self-custody — is kept intact.
3. **Non-Obscurity.** The method is public. It does not rely on
   hiding how it works, and it does not rely on convincing an
   attacker that your stash doesn't exist or is smaller than it is.
4. **Coercion-Resistance.** Threats and violence cannot extract the
   secret, because the knowledge that unlocks it is *tacit* (cannot
   be verbalized on demand) and the mechanism that deploys it is
   gated by an inescapably lengthy computation.

This combination — a tacit secret plus a computationally-gated
interface for deploying it — is called **Tacit Knowledge-Based
Authentication (TKBA)**. It is the only class of authentication that
can provide all four properties at once, and it is the theoretical
basis of Great Wallet.

## How you use it

Great Wallet has four modes that flow naturally into one another:

1. **Setup** — encode a fresh Bitcoin seed onto a fractal you will
   learn to remember.
2. **Train** — spaced-repetition practice that turns the encoding
   into reliable tacit recall.
3. **Accelerate** *(optional)* — outsource the waiting-time part of
   the computation over Lightning Network, anonymously, whenever you
   need faster access.
4. **Inherit** *(optional)* — configure a dead-man's-switch channel
   so your heirs can receive your funds if you can no longer unlock
   them yourself.

Setup and Train are the core flow. Accelerate and Inherit are opt-in
and can be added later.
