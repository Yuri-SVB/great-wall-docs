## Purpose

The Burning Ship encoder implements a **bijective mapping** between arbitrary
bit sequences and points in the complex plane, using the structure of the
[Burning Ship fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Ship_fractal) as
a deterministic, content-dependent partition function.

Given a bit string **b** of length *n*, the encoder produces a complex point
**(c_re, c_im)** in I4F60 fixed-point representation such that decoding that
point with the same parameters recovers **b** exactly. The mapping is injective
(distinct bit strings yield distinct points) and the round-trip is lossless.

The intended application is encoding small secrets (e.g. portions of a BIP-39
mnemonic seed) into fractal coordinates that can later be decoded without any
stored state beyond the shared parameters.

## Chained Protocol — Stage 0 Text, One Point Per Later Stage

**Official rule.** The protocol begins with a mandatory **stage 0 that carries
no point — only a short text input** — and then encodes **exactly one 32-bit
point per later stage**. Every stage (stage 0 included) is a link in one
memory-hard chain, and every point-bearing stage is its own fractal:

```
stage 0    =  text only (no point)  =  the salt/pepper that seeds the chain
one stage  =  one fractal           =  one haystack   (stages 1 .. N)
one point  =  one needle
```

`N = entropy_bits / 32` is the number of **point** stages (1 .. N); the total
stage count is `N + 1` because stage 0 is always present. Stage 0 is chained
into stage 1 **exactly like any other stage** — its text is the first input the
memory-hard chain consumes, so even stage 1's fractal depends on it:

```
θ_k  =  SHA-256( Argon2^N( stage-0 text  ‖  bits of points 1 .. k−1 ) )  →  (o, p, q)
```

with `N_iter` the user-chosen Argon2 iteration count. Because stage `k+1`'s
fractal cannot be derived until stage `k`'s point is fixed (the next θ depends
on all prior points *and* on stage-0 text), the derivations form a strict chain
— and each link is a full `N_iter`-iteration Argon2 run.

**No more "canonical fractal."** In `0.2.0` the first stage was the public,
canonical Burning Ship (`o = p = q = 0`) — a fractal an attacker already knew.
Seeding the chain from stage-0 text removes that privileged surface: **every**
point-bearing fractal (stage 1 included) is now private and chain-derived from a
user-controlled input. With a non-empty stage-0 label there is no fractal in the
setup that an attacker can know in advance. (An *empty* stage-0 text still
produces a deterministic base fractal, but it is no longer a special, named
"canonical" surface; interfaces should encourage a non-empty label.)

**Stage 0 as salt or pepper.** The same derivation that consumes stage-0 text
gives it two complementary uses:

- **Salt — a human label.** `MAIN-STASH`, `RETIREMENT`, `COLD-2026`: distinct
  labels deterministically fork the *entire* chain, so one memorised seed yields
  independent wallets per label with no extra entropy to store. The fork is
  total, and that is the point: the tacit **brain memory** of the setup yielded
  by one label is, **by design, not applicable** to the setups under other
  labels. Each label is its own independent labyrinth — recognition memory does
  not transfer between them, so training (or coercing) the recall of one reveals
  nothing about another.
- **Pepper — build one setup over another.** Feed in the output of a prior
  secret system — a password manager entry, a Shamir share, or a previous Great
  Wall setup — so setups *compose*: the Great Wall sits on top of an existing
  secret rather than beside it.

**Strong text restrictions (user safety).** *Every* stage text input — stage-0
text **and** the per-stage export label that every non-0 stage carries (see
*Master-Secret Export*) — is restricted to **upper-case ASCII alphanumerics and
`-` only** (`[A-Z0-9-]`, ASCII-encoded). The restriction exists so the same text
round-trips identically across devices, keyboards, locales, and clipboards — a
stray lower-case letter, accent, or Unicode look-alike would silently fork the
chain (or the export) into a different (unrecoverable) result. The GUI input
field enforces this live: it **up-cases** typed letters and **rejects**
characters outside the set, and in both cases **signals the user that a
restriction is being applied** (so the divergence is never silent). See
*GUI Viewer → Stage 0 text input*.

**Illustrative stage-0 labels (generic).** The labels below are *illustrative
archetypes*, not prescriptions — they describe the kind of custody a setup
serves. They span the threat model the tool is built for: anyone whose key
custodian is a target for coercion.

| Category                             | Example labels |
|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| Personal / family                    | `PERSONAL-COLD-STORAGE`, `FAMILY-INHERITANCE-2040`, `KIDS-COLLEGE`, `RETIREMENT` |
| Institutional / corporate treasury   | `CORP-TREASURY-COLD-001`, `BOARD-MULTISIG-3-OF-5`, `FOUNDATION-ENDOWMENT-RESERVE` |
| Sovereign / national reserve         | `SOVEREIGN-COLD-RESERVE`, `CENTRAL-BANK-RESERVE`, `STRATEGIC-NATIONAL-RESERVE` |
| Trade secret / IP                    | `TRADE-SECRET-FORMULA`, `PROPRIETARY-RECIPE-VAULT`, `PATENT-BLUEPRINT` |
| Whistleblower / investigative        | `WHISTLEBLOWER-EVIDENCE-VAULT`, `WITNESS-TESTIMONY-ESCROW` |
| Press freedom / source protection    | `HUMAN-RIGHTS-DOSSIER`, `PRESS-FREEDOM-LEDGER` |
| Military protocols / classified docs | `MANHATTAN-PROJECT`, `HQ-NUMBER-STATION-CODES`, `OPERATION-XYZ-FILES` |

**Why one point per (later) stage.** The design goal is *haystack ≫ needle*:
specifying *which* fractal (the haystack) must cost far more than specifying
*where* in it the point sits (the needle, ≈ 32 bits). Chaining one point per
stage multiplies the cost of descriptively bypassing the memory-hard derivation
by the number of stages: a perceptual-oracle attacker who tries to *describe* a
fractal instead of deriving it must reconstruct *every* fractal in the chain,
and cannot start on stage `k+1` until stage `k`'s point is fixed. So the
labyrinth-description cost `D_θ` scales with the number of stages while a single
point stays ≈ 32 bits — the inequality `D_θ ≫ D_pt` is enforced per stage and
compounded across the chain. (See
`great-wall-docs/next-steps/research-notes-substrate-hardness.md` for the full
security analysis and the deferred parameter-family discussion.)

**Breaking change.** This supersedes the `0.2.0` chain (one point per stage,
canonical first fractal, `SHA512` carry-over) and the earlier two-stage /
multiple-points-per-stage prototype. It is a **hard, backward-incompatible**
protocol update: encodings do not round-trip across the change, and old
session/vector documents are not compatible.

**Pipeline.** The chained pipeline is the single source of truth in
`great-wall-core/burning_ship/protocol.py`
(`encode_entropy` / `decode_entropy` / `stage_params`); the CLI and GUI both
drive their encode/decode through it. The per-stage memory-hard derivation lives
in `argon2_pipeline.derive_stage_params` (built on the reusable
`argon2_iterate`).

## No Floating-Point in Deterministic Paths

**Every computation that affects the encode/decode bijection is performed in
integer or fixed-point arithmetic.** IEEE 754 floating-point (`f64`) is used
*only* for display, debug output, and the pixel-grid rendering viewport.

No `f64` operation participates in:

- PRNG seeding or generation
- Island barycenter computation (accumulated as `i128`, divided as integer)
- Island weighting (integer inverse-count weights)
- Split coordinate computation (Fixed)
- Contraction factor computation (integer fraction `num/den`)
- Contraction application (`i128` multiply + divide)
- Child selection or point membership tests
- Initial area bounds (passed as raw `i64` Fixed across FFI)

The FFI boundary passes all encode/decode coordinates as `Fixed`
(`#[repr(transparent)]` newtype over `i64`), eliminating the earlier `f64`
conversion at entry.  The Python bridge stores `Rect` values as raw `i64`
and provides `_f64()` accessors for display only.

---

## Fixed-Point Arithmetic (I4F60)

All fractal computation uses a custom 64-bit signed fixed-point format called
**I4F60**:

```
 Bit 63 (sign)    Bits 62–60 (integer)    Bits 59–0 (fraction)
┌──┬──────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ S│  3 int bits  │            60 fractional bits            │
└──┴──────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Total width:** 64 bits (stored as Rust `i64`)
- **Integer range:** [-8, +8)
- **Fractional precision:** 2^(-60) ≈ 8.67 × 10^(-19)
- **The constant ONE:** `1i64 << 60`

### Why fixed-point?

1. **Determinism.** IEEE 754 floating-point can produce platform-dependent
   results due to extended precision, FMA fusion, and rounding-mode
   differences. Fixed-point addition and subtraction are exact; multiplication
   uses a widening `i64 → i128` product followed by a right-shift, which is
   fully deterministic on any two's-complement architecture.

2. **Natural escape criterion.** Rather than testing `|z| > R` for some
   bailout radius, the engine treats *any arithmetic overflow* as escape.
   This is both simpler and more precise: it catches divergence the instant
   the orbit leaves the representable range.

### Checked operations

Every arithmetic step returns `Option<Fixed>`:

| Operation      | Implementation                                                |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `checked_add`  | `i64::checked_add` — detects signed overflow                  |
| `checked_sub`  | `i64::checked_sub` — detects signed overflow                  |
| `checked_mul`  | Widen to `i128`, multiply, right-shift by 60, range-check     |
| `checked_abs`  | Returns `None` for `i64::MIN` (no positive counterpart)       |
| `checked_neg`  | `i64::checked_neg` — catches `i64::MIN`                       |
| `midpoint`     | `(a >> 1) + (b >> 1) + (a & b & 1)` — overflow-free          |

---

## The Burning Ship Fractal

The Burning Ship fractal is defined by the recurrence:

```
z₀ = 0

z_{n+1} = ( |Re(zₙ)| + i·|Im(zₙ)| )² + c
```

Expanding the squaring step:

```
Re(z_{n+1}) = |Re(zₙ)|²  −  |Im(zₙ)|²  +  Re(c)
Im(z_{n+1}) = 2·|Re(zₙ)|·|Im(zₙ)|      +  Im(c)
```

A point **c** is *in the set* if the orbit never escapes (i.e. never
overflows). The **escape count** is the iteration index at which the first
overflow occurs, or `None` if the point survives `max_iter` iterations.

### Computation sequence

For each iteration the engine performs these checked steps in order:

1. `abs_zr = |Re(z)|` — overflow if `z_re == i64::MIN`
2. `zr2 = abs_zr * abs_zr` — widening multiply + shift
3. `zi2 = z_im * z_im`
4. `diff = zr2 - zi2`
5. `new_re = diff + c_re`
6. `abs_zi = |Im(z)|` — overflow if `z_im == i64::MIN`
7. `prod = abs_zr * abs_zi`
8. `double_prod = prod * 2` — checked left-shift by 1
9. `new_im = double_prod + c_im`

If *any* step returns `None`, the point escapes at that iteration.

---

## Island Discovery

An **island** is a connected region of the complex plane where all points
share the same escape count. Islands capture the nested, self-similar
structure of the fractal boundary.

### Algorithm

1. **Seed the PRNG.** A SplitMix64 generator is deterministically seeded from
   the **bisection path string** (accumulated history of directional choices)
   plus a fixed extra seed value (`rng_seed`). This ensures that *the same
   path always produces the same island set*.

2. **Random sampling.** Draw random points uniformly within the rectangle.
   Skip points that collide with the stored flood-fill data (see step 7).

3. **Escape test.** Compute the escape count at each sample point. Skip
   points that are inside the set (escape count = `None`) or have low
   escape count (< 20). Empirically, the first meaningful islands only
   appear around escape count ~17; points below this threshold are
   trivially far from the fractal boundary and never form useful
   connected regions.

4. **Flood fill (BFS).** From each qualifying sample point, expand in
   4-connected directions at a fixed step size (`pixel_delta`). Only include
   neighbours with the *same* escape count. Neighbours with a **higher**
   escape count are treated as **boundary** (farther from the set — not
   expanded). Neighbours with a **lower** escape count are noted as
   candidates for redirection (see step 6). Track visited cells on a
   discretized grid (coordinates divided by `pixel_delta`) to avoid revisits.

5. **Adaptive resolution.** The initial pixel step size `p0` is the largest
   power-of-two such that `(width × height) / p0² ≥ min_grid_cells`. If
   the flood fill hits the point budget (`max_flood_points`) at the current
   resolution, the pixel size is doubled (one left-shift) and the fill
   retries. If the pixel size reaches the coarsest allowed
   (`min(width, height) >> p_max_shift`) and the budget is still exceeded,
   the region is marked "too large" and excluded.

6. **Lower-escape redirection.** If a flood fill encounters *any* neighbour
   whose escape count is lower than the target (but still ≥ 20), the fill
   restarts from that lower-escape point. Lower escape counts correspond to
   regions
   *closer* to the fractal boundary, which tend to form larger connected
   components (true islands) rather than isolated single-pixel noise.
   Conversely, higher-escape neighbours are treated strictly as boundary and
   never trigger redirection — they represent points farther from the set
   whose escape-count bands fragment into chaotic, unconnectable singletons
   at fine resolution.

7. **Collision store (FloodFillStore).** All flood-filled points are stored in
   a single lexicographically ordered `BTreeSet<(re, im, flood_id)>`. Each
   entry records the raw `i64` coordinates of a visited point together with the
   ID of the flood fill that produced it. Before starting a new flood fill from
   a random sample, the algorithm tests the sample point against this store
   using a **single vicinity check** at the coarsest pixel radius
   (`pixel_delta` at `p_max_shift`):

   - **Exact coincidence:** if any stored point has the same `(re, im)`, the
     sample is skipped immediately.
   - **Interior test:** the store scans all entries whose `re` lies within
     `[query_re − radius, query_re + radius]` and whose `im` lies within
     `[query_im − radius, query_im + radius]`.  For each stored point it
     records which cardinal direction it lies in relative to the query (left,
     right, above, below) using per-flood-ID bitflags.  If any single flood ID
     has points in **all four** cardinal directions, the query point is interior
     to that flood fill and the sample is skipped.

   This replaces the earlier two-BTreeMap design and multi-radius doubling loop
   with a single data structure and a single-pass range scan.

8. **Termination.** Stop when any of: `target_good` islands found,
   `exclusion_threshold_num / 256` of the total area excluded (tracked as
   precise pixel-count × pixel-delta² sums in `u128`), or `max_attempts`
   samples drawn.

### Island record

Each discovered island stores:

| Field          | Type       | Meaning                                           |
|----------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `center_re`    | `Fixed`    | Barycenter (integer mean of flood-filled points)  |
| `center_im`    | `Fixed`    |                                                   |
| `pixel_count`  | `u64`      | Number of flood-filled cells                      |
| `pixel_delta`  | `Fixed`    | Step size used during the flood fill               |
| `escape_count` | `u32`      | Shared escape count of all points                 |
| `bbox`         | `Rect`     | Bounding box of the flood-filled region           |

The barycenter is computed by accumulating coordinates in `i128` and dividing
by count — no floating-point involved.

### SplitMix64 PRNG

The PRNG used for all random sampling is SplitMix64, with wrapping arithmetic
on `u64`:

```
z ← z +w 0x9E3779B97F4A7C15         (golden-ratio increment, wrapping add)
z ← z ⊕ (z >> 30)
z ← z ×w 0xBF58476D1CE4E5B9         (wrapping multiply)
z ← z ⊕ (z >> 27)
z ← z ×w 0x94D049BB133111EB         (wrapping multiply)
z ← z ⊕ (z >> 31)
```

This is a well-known, fast, full-period 64-bit generator with good
statistical quality. Its determinism is critical: given the same seed, encode
and decode will discover *identical* island sets.

### PRNG seeding from path string

The PRNG is seeded from the **bisection path string** (not the rectangle
coordinates), combined with a fixed extra seed (`rng_seed`, default `0x42`).
Each byte of the path is folded into the state via XOR + SplitMix64:

```
h ← rng_seed
for each byte b in path_string:
    h ← h ⊕ b;  h ← splitmix(h)
state ← h
```

This makes the PRNG depend on the abstract bisection history rather than the
concrete coordinate values, which is more meaningful and stable across the
full pipeline (see "Path String" below).

---

## The Bisection Tree (Encoding)

The encoder maps a bit string to a point by recursively bisecting a rectangle,
using fractal structure to guide each split. For each input bit, the rectangle
is split in two and one half is selected.

### Step-by-step

For each bit *bᵢ* in the input:

1. **Discover islands** in the current rectangle (as described above).

2. **Compute the weighted median** of all discovered island barycenters along
   the split axis. Each island's weight is its *score*, computed as a
   fixed-point logarithm:

   ```
   scoreⱼ = log₂(good_total_area / flood_areaⱼ)     (fixed-point u128, 16 fractional bits)
   ```

   where `flood_areaⱼ = pixel_countⱼ × pixel_deltaⱼ²` and
   `good_total_area` is the sum over all good islands (all in `u128`).
   The `log₂` is computed via a bitwise algorithm (MSB position for the
   integer part, repeated squaring for fractional bits) — no floating-point.
   This compresses the dynamic range, preventing extremely small islands from
   dominating the median while preserving fine-grained discrimination between
   islands of similar size.

   The weighted median is the coordinate where the cumulative weight from
   below reaches half the total weight. All weights, sums, and comparisons
   are `u128` — no floating-point is involved. The island coordinates are
   `Fixed` (`i64`); sorting is by raw `i64` value. The result is a `Fixed`
   coordinate taken directly from an island barycenter.

3. **Choose the split axis:** the longer dimension of the current rectangle
   (vertical if width ≥ height, horizontal otherwise). Width and height are
   compared as raw `i64` differences.

4. **Clamp the barycenter** to within 10% of the edges. The margin is
   computed as `span / 10` (integer division) where `span` is the rectangle's
   extent along the split axis. This prevents degenerate near-empty children:
   without clamping, a barycenter very close to one edge could produce a child
   with near-zero area, leaving too little room for meaningful island
   discovery on subsequent levels. The 10% margin ensures the smaller child
   always gets at least 10% of the split dimension — small enough to allow
   genuinely asymmetric splits, but large enough to prevent pathological
   degeneracy.

5. **Split at the clamped barycenter.** Two child rectangles are created,
   sharing the non-split dimension.

6. **Identify children by span along the split axis.** The child whose span
   (in raw `i64` units) is larger is the "larger" child; the other is the
   "smaller" child. This comparison uses only integer subtraction.

### Directional bit semantics

Bits map to spatial direction, not relative size:

- **Vertical split** (split on re axis): `0 = left` (lo re), `1 = right` (hi re)
- **Horizontal split** (split on im axis): `0 = up` (hi im), `1 = down` (lo im)

The `chose_larger` flag is *derived* from which child the directional choice
lands on (does the chosen child happen to be the larger one?), rather than
driving the choice.  Contraction still applies when the larger child is
selected, regardless of which bit value triggered it.

7. **Consume bit *bᵢ*:**
   - `bᵢ = 0` → select the left (vertical) or up (horizontal) child
   - `bᵢ = 1` → select the right (vertical) or down (horizontal) child

8. **Contract (if larger selected).** When the chosen child happens to be the
   larger one, it is contracted toward the split line to prevent exponential
   area growth relative to the smaller child. The contraction factor is
   computed as an exact integer fraction:

   ```
   s = min(lo_span, hi_span)      (smaller child's span, i64)
   l = max(lo_span, hi_span)      (larger child's span, i64)

   numerator   = l + 3·s
   denominator = 4·l
   ```

   This implements `f(r) = (1 + 3r) / 4` where `r = s/l`, entirely in
   integer arithmetic. The contraction is applied as:

   ```
   new_edge_distance = old_edge_distance × numerator / denominator
   ```

   computed in `i128` to avoid overflow. When children are equal
   (`s = l`), `f = 1` (no contraction). When maximally unequal
   (`s → 0`), `f = 1/4` (contract to 25% of original span).

9. **Continue** with the contracted/selected child as the new rectangle.

After all bits are consumed, the **center of the final rectangle** is the
encoded point (computed via the overflow-free `midpoint` operation).

### Fallback

If island discovery finds no islands (the rectangle contains only set-interior
or trivially-escaping points), the encoder falls back to **geometric
bisection** at the rectangle's center (via `midpoint`), with no contraction.

---

## Path String

The bisection tree builds a **path string** that encodes the full history of
directional choices.  The string starts with `O` (origin) and appends one
character per bisection level:

| Split axis   | Direction | Smaller half | Larger half |
|-------------|-----------|:------------:|:-----------:|
| Vertical    | Left      | `l`          | `L`         |
| Vertical    | Right     | `r`          | `R`         |
| Horizontal  | Up        | `u`          | `U`         |
| Horizontal  | Down      | `d`          | `D`         |

Lowercase = the chosen half is the smaller one; UPPERCASE = the larger one.

### Path prefix per point

Each point's bisection starts from `path_prefix = "O"`, regardless of
preceding points. This makes the area tree an **invariant property of each
fractal** — determined solely by (o, p, q) — rather than depending on the
encoding pipeline order. Same entropy bits always produce the same area tree.

---

## Decoding

Decoding reproduces the *exact same* bisection tree — because the tree is
fully determined by the path prefix and the deterministic PRNG — and reads off
which half contains the query point at each level.

Encode and decode share a single implementation (`bisect_core`) that
parameterizes over whether bits come from input (encode) or are inferred from
point membership (decode).

For each bit position *i* from 0 to *n−1*:

1. Reproduce the island discovery, barycenter, and split (identical to
   encoding — same rectangle, same PRNG seed, same result).

2. Test which child contains the query point:
   - If the point coordinate along the split axis is `≥ split_coord`, the
     point is in `child_hi`; otherwise in `child_lo`.
   - Map to directional bit: for vertical splits, `hi = right = 1`,
     `lo = left = 0`.  For horizontal splits, `hi = up = 0`,
     `lo = down = 1`.

3. Apply the same contraction to the selected child.

4. Continue with the next level.

The decoded bit string is the sequence of 0/1 values recovered at each level.

### Encoded point representation

The encoded point is returned as a pair of **raw `i64` values** (the internal
`Fixed` representation). The decoder accepts raw `i64` values directly. This
avoids any `f64 → Fixed → f64` round-trip that could introduce
non-determinism. The Python bridge exposes both:

- `point_re`, `point_im`: `f64` values for display/visualization
- `point_re_raw`, `point_im_raw`: `i64` values for exact decode

### Why is this a bijection?

- **Determinism:** The PRNG is seeded from the path string (accumulated
  bisection history). Given the same path prefix and parameters, discovery
  always produces the same islands, the same weights, the same barycenter,
  and the same split. Encode and decode therefore walk the same tree.

- **No floating-point:** Every step from PRNG through barycenter, split,
  contraction, and membership test uses only integer/fixed-point arithmetic.
  The result is identical on any conforming two's-complement implementation.

- **Semi-open intervals:** All rectangles use the convention `[min, max)` —
  closed on the lower bound, open on the upper. `Rect::contains` tests
  `re >= re_min && re < re_max && im >= im_min && im < im_max`. At each
  split, the two children `[min, split)` and `[split, max)` partition
  the parent exactly with no overlap. The decode test `point >= split_coord`
  assigns boundary points unambiguously to the high child.

- **Injectivity:** Different bit strings select different paths through the
  tree. Different paths lead to non-overlapping final rectangles. The
  centers of non-overlapping rectangles are distinct points.

---

## Precision Limits

With I4F60 (60 fractional bits), the representable precision is ~10^(−18).
Each bisection level roughly halves one dimension of the rectangle, consuming
approximately 1 bit of positional precision. After *n* bisections, the
rectangle's smaller dimension has shrunk by a factor of roughly 2^n (modulated
by contraction).

In practice, the encoder reliably handles **32 bits per point.** Beyond that,
the rectangle becomes too small for island discovery to find meaningful
structure at the minimum pixel resolution.

The protocol encodes **exactly one 32-bit point per point stage** (see *Chained
Protocol — Stage 0 Text, One Point Per Later Stage* below), so the number of
**point** stages `N` equals the entropy size divided by 32 — equivalently, words
divided by 3 — atop a mandatory, point-less **stage 0** (total stages `N + 1`).
Every BIP39 size that is a multiple of 32 bits is supported uniformly, from 32
bits up to a hard cap of 256:

| Words | Entropy  | Point stages (N) | Total stages (incl. stage 0) | Tier |
|------:|---------:|-----------------:|-----------------------------:|------|
| 3     | 32 bits  | 1                | 2                            | sub-standard |
| 6     | 64 bits  | 2                | 3                            | sub-standard |
| 9     | 96 bits  | 3                | 4                            | sub-standard |
| 12    | 128 bits | 4                | 5                            | standard (default) |
| 15    | 160 bits | 5                | 6                            | standard |
| 18    | 192 bits | 6                | 7                            | standard |
| 21    | 224 bits | 7                | 8                            | standard |
| 24    | 256 bits | 8                | 9                            | standard |

Every point stage (1 .. N) encodes its 32-bit point on a *perturbed* fractal
whose parameters (o, p, q) are derived from the memory-hard hash of **stage-0
text plus all preceding points** (Argon2 → SHA-256 → θ). Unlike `0.2.0`, **none
of these fractals is public** — there is no canonical first surface; with a
non-empty stage-0 label all `N` haystacks are secret and chain-derived.

**Exact, bidirectional BIP39 ⇄ Great Wall conversion is preserved at every size,
including the sub-standard ones.** A `3·N`-word mnemonic encodes losslessly to
`N` points and decodes back to the identical mnemonic. This is retained
deliberately for two reasons: (1) **interoperability** — a Great Wall setup can
be imported into, or exported from, any BIP39 wallet at any supported size; and
(2) **reassurance** — a skeptical user who doubts that the fractal mapping is
truly lossless can verify the round-trip themselves, in either direction, and
watch their exact words come back.

### Size range, the 256-bit cap, and the iteration policy

- **Hard cap at 256 bits / 24 words / 8 stages** (`constants.MAX_ENTROPY_BITS`).
  Larger mnemonics are valid BIP39 in principle but deliberately *not* offered:
  one more stage is the same marginal mental effort for diminishing returns, so
  the better lever past 24 words is **more between-stage Argon2 iterations**, not
  more stages. Interfaces should advise this. A user with a specific reason to
  exceed 256 bits could chain multiple setups via a future "advanced pepper"
  field (pepper = a prior setup's result) — tracked in next-steps; revisit.
- **Sub-standard sizes (32/64/96 bits)** sit below BIP39's 128-bit floor and are
  offered for completeness. The **32-bit / single-point** mode (stage 0 + one
  point stage) still runs the memory-hard chain — stage 1's fractal is derived
  from stage-0 text — so even here there is no public canonical surface; its
  coercion-resistance is *minimal but nonzero*: a wrench attacker without a Great
  Wall–compatible app still fails, and setup beats the brute-force resistance of
  a 9-decimal-digit PIN. 128 bits (12 words) is the recommended default.
- **One Argon2 iteration count per setup, calibrated on-device (official).** To
  prevent parameter explosion, a single iteration count `N` is fixed at setup
  and applied to *every* stage (`protocol.encode_entropy` / `decode_entropy`
  take one `iterations`). **`N` is the durable parameter; wall-clock "hours" is
  only a perishable label on it** — recovery reproduces the digest from `N`, not
  from a duration, so hardware progress (notably AI-driven memory-bandwidth
  gains) changes only the *time a given `N` takes*, never correctness or the
  entropy/OOM-gate security. Accordingly:
  - The interface offers a few **target wall-clock durations** and **calibrates
    `N` per setup on the user's own device** (micro-benchmark a few passes at the
    chosen memory profile → solve for `N`). This removes dev-time and
    cross-hardware staleness; only the genuine setup→recovery temporal drift
    remains, and it is harmless to correctness.
  - **`N` (and the memory profile `m`) is the user's responsibility to
    memorize** (needed if the device/setup is lost — "hard recovery"). Two
    mitigations: (a) the protocol gracefully stores the **sequence of
    intermediate derivation results**, from which the user can *recognize* the
    correct one (checkpoint trial-and-error; see *Checkpointing*), so an
    approximate memory of `N` suffices — in this design `N` and `m` are the
    *only* inter-stage unknowns (the per-stage `o,p,q` are derived from them and
    the prior points), and once the parameter space expands this *same*
    recognition recovers any forgotten inter-stage parameter (next-steps §5);
    (b) the **Celestial-Peace-Never-Forget** trainer (`celestial-peace-nf-core`)
    drills explicit recall of `N` and `m` — safe because they are *parameters,
    not the tacit secret*. Note `m` must be recalled exactly (a wrong profile
    breaks every derived fractal); `N` only approximately.
  - UX should induce users to set the derivation time **conservatively (e.g.
    2×)**, then use a **TLP / `jade-clock`** layer to freely adjust the *effective
    per-session* delay (the RSW time-lock puzzle re-imposes a tunable, possibly
    outsourced, delay on top of the fixed `N`). See `great-wallet`.
  - This per-setup-calibration policy is **official**; per-stage iteration
    variation remains deferred (see next-steps) and may be revisited.

## Default Initial Area

The default rectangle covers the **base Burning Ship fractal region** (the
viewport for every stage's perturbed surface; no longer a privileged "canonical"
fractal — see *Chained Protocol*):

```
Re ∈ [−2.5, +1.5)      Im ∈ [−2.0, +1.5)
```

This 4.0 × 3.5 rectangle tightly contains the main body and principal
miniatures of the Burning Ship fractal, ensuring that random sampling
concentrates on structurally interesting regions rather than wasting
attempts on trivially-escaping points far from the set.

## Discovery Parameters

All parameters are integers — no floating-point values cross the API boundary.

The GUI uses faster, coarser parameters than the Rust defaults to keep encoding
interactive. The test suite uses its own set (`max_iter=200`, `target_good=30`,
`max_flood_points=10000`, `min_grid_cells=1024`, `p_max_shift=1`,
`exclusion_threshold_num=204`).

## FFI Interface

The Rust engine is compiled as a C dynamic library (`cdylib`). All exported
symbols use the `bs_` prefix and C calling convention (`extern "C"`).

**Key FFI changes from earlier versions:**

- All encode/decode area bounds and output coordinates are `Fixed`
  (`#[repr(transparent)]` over `i64`), not `f64`.
- `bs_encode_result_point` replaces the old `_point` (f64) and `_point_raw`
  (i64) pair — there is now only one accessor returning `Fixed`.
- `bs_encode`, `bs_decode`, `bs_decode_full` accept a **path prefix**
  (`*const u8` + length) for pipeline chaining.
- `bs_encode_result_path` is new: returns the accumulated path string.
- `bs_encode_result_step` returns split_coord as `Fixed`, contraction as
  separate `u64` numerator/denominator (not a single `f64` ratio).

---

## Determinism Contract

The round-trip guarantee depends on **exact reproducibility** across encode
and decode calls. The following invariants must hold:

1. The fixed-point format (I4F60) is identical: 60 fractional bits, `i64`
   storage, `i128` intermediate for multiplication.
2. The PRNG (SplitMix64) is seeded identically from the **path string**
   (byte-by-byte XOR + SplitMix64) with the same `rng_seed` value.
3. The island discovery algorithm (sampling order, flood fill BFS in
   4-connected order: +re, −re, +im, −im, collision store with single
   coarsest-radius vicinity test) is identical.
4. The weighted median uses fixed-point `u128` scores
   (`log2(good_total_area / flood_area)` with 16 fractional bits, computed
   via bitwise algorithm) for ordering. The resulting split coordinate is a
   `Fixed` value taken directly from an island barycenter. No floating-point
   is involved in score computation or median selection.
5. The contraction is the exact integer fraction `(l + 3s) / (4l)`, applied
   via `i128` multiply-then-divide.
6. The encoded point is stored and transmitted as raw `i64` values (not
   `f64`).  All area bounds cross the FFI as `Fixed` (`i64`).
7. The **path prefix** is always `"O"` for every point. The area tree is an
   invariant property of each fractal (determined by o, p, q alone).
8. **Inherited seeds** (flood-fill points from the previous bisection level)
   must be carried forward between levels. For incremental encoding, seeds
   are serialized across the FFI as 24-byte records (re: i64 LE, im: i64 LE,
   esc: u32 LE, pad: u32).

**No floating-point operation participates in any determinism-critical path.**

Any change to these components — even a different BFS neighbor order in the
flood fill — will break the bijection. This is by design: the fractal
structure serves as a shared, implicit codebook that both parties can
reconstruct independently.

## GUI Viewer: BIP39 Encode and Decode Workflows

The viewer (`viewer.py`) provides two complementary workflows: **encoding** a
BIP39 mnemonic into fractal points (one point per stage), and **decoding**
user-selected fractal points back into entropy bits.

### Chained encoding architecture

The setup opens with a text-only **stage 0**; the entropy is then split into
`N = entropy_bits / 32` chunks of 32 bits, one per **point** stage, each encoded
as a single point on its own fractal surface:

| Stage   | Carries     | Parameters     | Derived from                                         |
|---------|-------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 0       | text only   | — (no fractal) | user input (`[A-Z0-9-]`, ASCII) — salt / pepper      |
| k (1..N)| one point   | Argon2-derived | SHA-256(Argon2^N(stage-0 text ‖ points 1 .. k−1))    |

Each point stage's parameters (o, p, q) are derived from the memory-hard hash of
**stage-0 text plus all preceding points**, so every fractal surface depends on
the entire prefix before it — a strict chain that begins at stage-0 text. There
is no public, canonical fractal: stage 1 already depends on the user's stage-0
label. The user enters stage-0 text, then fixes one point per stage and runs the
(memory-hard) Argon2 step to unlock the next stage's fractal, repeating until the
last stage; only then is the full mnemonic recovered. With `N_iter ≥ 1` the
honest cost is `N` chained Argon2 runs (stage 0 → 1, then one per point stage).
The sections below — written when the prototype used two stages with P1/P2/…
points — illustrate the per-stage mechanics; under the current protocol each
point stage contributes exactly one point and the Argon2 transition repeats
between every consecutive pair of stages, starting from stage 0.

### Stage 0 text input

Stage 0 is a mandatory text field — no point is clicked or rendered — whose
content seeds the whole chain. Two design rules govern it:

**Character restrictions (enforced live, never silent).** Accepted input is
**upper-case ASCII alphanumerics and the hyphen only** (`[A-Z0-9-]`). The field:

- **up-cases** letters as they are typed (so `main-stash` becomes `MAIN-STASH`),
  and
- **rejects** any character outside the set (accents, spaces, punctuation,
  Unicode look-alikes, control bytes).

In *both* cases the GUI **signals that a restriction was applied** — a brief
status-bar note and/or a field flash — so the user always knows their keystroke
was transformed or dropped. The restriction is a safety measure, not cosmetic:
the same label must hash to the same chain on every device, keyboard layout,
locale, and clipboard, and a single un-normalised character would silently fork
the setup into a different, unrecoverable wallet.

**Visibility toggle.** The field offers a show/hide toggle (like a password
box). It defaults to hidden because stage-0 text is frequently a **pepper** —
the output of another secret system (a password-manager entry, a Shamir share,
or a prior Great Wall setup) — which the user wants masked. When stage-0 text is
merely a **salt** (a non-secret label such as `RETIREMENT`) the user can reveal
it to confirm spelling. The *same* derivation scheme serves both roles: the
engine does not distinguish a salt-label from a pepper-secret — only the user's
intent (and whether the input is itself secret) differs.

**Per-stage export-label fields (non-0 stages).** The same restricted text widget
(identical `[A-Z0-9-]` up-case/reject/signal behaviour and visibility toggle)
reappears at **every non-0 stage**, supplying that stage's **master-secret export
label** — appended to the Argon2id message (the export uses a fixed salt; see
*Master-Secret Export*). It is independent of stage-0 text and is available at
each stage boundary **without** waiting for later stages, so a user can export /
carry over at any truncation point.

### Argon2 transition (Stage 1 → Stage 2)

After encoding P1 and P2, the viewer derives the Stage 2 perturbation.
Three fixed profiles control the Argon2 parameters — the user chooses one at
setup time:

| Profile          | `m` (memory) | `p` (parallelism) | `t` (time cost) | Target device          |
|------------------|-------------:|--------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Basic**        |        1 GiB | 1                  | 2                | Mobile (3–4 GB+)       |
| **Advanced**     |       32 GiB | 1                  | 2                | Desktop (48–64 GB)     |
| **Great Wall**   |      128 GiB | 1                  | 2                | Server (192+ GB)       |

**Basic** is heavy but doable on any modern smartphone.  **Advanced** requires
a serious desktop (48–64 GB system RAM) — the typical Bitcoin / CS enthusiast
can afford it.  **Great Wall** requires server-class hardware (192+ GB); beyond
this threshold, users should consider a custom setup.  All profiles use Argon2d
v0x13 with salt `b"greatwall"` and produce a 32-byte digest.

#### Why p=1 for all tiers

Argon2 supports `p > 1` for password-hashing scenarios where the defender has a
hard wall-clock budget (e.g. ~1 s per login attempt).  More parallel lanes let
the defender pack more total work into that fixed time window, raising the cost
per attacker guess.

Great Wall inverts this assumption: **the delay is the product, not a
constraint to minimise**.  If the defender has 4 cores and sets `p = 4`, they
finish 4× faster — but then the outer iteration count must be 4× higher to
fill the same target delay.  The net result is identical wall-clock time and
total work, except now the attacker's GPU or ASIC can exploit 4 independent
lanes in parallel.

With `p = 1` the entire computation is a single sequential chain of
memory-dependent operations.  This maximises two security metrics:

1. **OOM gate** (what % of weaker adversaries are excluded).  Total memory =
   `p × m`.  With `p = 1` the OOM threshold equals `m` itself — an attacker
   cannot reduce memory usage by serialising lanes one at a time.
2. **Attacker/defender compute ratio** (how much faster a stronger adversary
   can go).  An attacker cannot parallelise *within* a single lane because each
   step depends on the previous one.  The defender's commodity CPU is
   near-optimal for sequential memory-hard work, so the ratio stays close to 1.

The only tier-variable parameter is therefore `m` (memory): it controls which
devices are OOM-gated.  The total work is determined by the number of external
iterations `N`, which is chosen to meet the user's target delay.

#### Why t=2 (two internal passes)

With `t = 1`, Argon2 fills the memory array in a single sequential pass.  Once
block *i+1* is computed, block *i* is never read again — an attacker can
exploit this by discarding blocks and recomputing them on demand, trading time
for memory (the classic time-memory tradeoff).

With `t ≥ 2`, the second pass re-reads the entire array in a data-dependent
pattern (Argon2d).  Every block from pass 1 might be referenced at any point
during pass 2, so the attacker must keep the full `m` allocation resident at
the pass boundary or face a quadratic (or worse) recomputation penalty.

`t = 2` is the minimum needed to guarantee that the full memory array must be
simultaneously resident.  `t > 2` would add marginal hardness at the cost of
proportionally more wall-clock time per external iteration — since `N` is
adjusted to fill the target delay anyway, `t = 2` is the sweet spot.

#### Why Argon2d (not Argon2i or Argon2id)

Argon2i uses data-independent memory access patterns to resist side-channel
attacks — critical when the secret is a short password typed into a shared
server.  Argon2id is a hybrid (Argon2i for the first pass, Argon2d thereafter).

In Great Wall the "secret" is 64 bits of entropy derived from a BIP-39
mnemonic, processed on the user's own device.  Side-channel resistance is
irrelevant: the user controls the hardware, and 64-bit entropy cannot be
brute-forced even with full knowledge of access patterns.

Argon2d's data-dependent addressing makes its memory-hardness strictly
stronger: the access pattern depends on the data, so an attacker cannot
precompute which memory cells will be needed and must keep the full allocation
resident.  This maximises the memory-hardness guarantee — exactly what we want
for the OOM gate.

#### Factoring external iterations

The user's target delay (hours, days, or weeks) determines the total number of
external iterations `N`.  To make the protocol more forgiving when the user
forgets the exact iteration count, `N` is factored into two levels:

```
N = n_checkpoints × iters_per_checkpoint
```

- **`iters_per_checkpoint`**: chosen so that one checkpoint interval takes a
  convenient wall-clock duration (e.g. 30 minutes or 1 hour).  The checkpoint
  file records every intermediate digest at checkpoint boundaries.
- **`n_checkpoints`**: the number of such intervals needed to reach the target
  delay.

If the user forgets whether they chose 48 or 50 hours, they only need to try a
few nearby checkpoint counts — each trial is a single Argon2d pass plus a
Stage 2 encode, not a full re-computation.  The checkpoint file also enables
resumption after interruption.

The user controls only the number of *external iterations* (hash-then-feed-back
cycles).  This determines the wall-clock time cost.

```

    │   Each iteration feeds the previous 32-byte digest back as input.

    │   "save intermediate" checkbox is on (off by default — see below).
    ▼

    ▼
Stage 2 fractal with perturbation *p* is now active.
```

#### Checkpointing

The checkpoint file (`.argon2_checkpoint_{input_hex}_{profile}.bin`) stores a
sequence of 36-byte records: 4-byte LE iteration index + 32-byte digest.  This
serves two purposes:

1. **Resume after interruption**: on restart, the highest saved iteration ≤ the
   target is used as the starting point, avoiding redundant computation.
2. **Trial-and-error on iteration count**: if the user forgets the exact number
   of external iterations, they can try nearby values cheaply — each is a simple
   lookup + stage-2 encode, no re-hashing required.

##### Gating: the "save intermediate" checkbox (off by default)

Checkpointing is gated by a checkbox in the Argon2 row of the viewer panel,
mirrored by the `state.argon2_save_intermediate` flag (default: `False`).
When the flag is **off**, `run_argon2_iterative()` and `run_random_encode()`
neither read nor write any checkpoint file — the derivation runs fully
in-memory and the only persistent output is the final digest written into
the session JSON (when the user explicitly saves one).

This default is deliberate.  An intermediate-state file is exactly the
artifact that lets an attacker bypass the time cost Argon2 imposes: if
iteration 9 999 of a 10 000-iteration target sits on disk, the entire
derivation collapses to a single Argon2d pass.  Convenience features
(resume, trial-and-error) must therefore be opt-in, never default.

**User responsibility (documented in README and on toggling the checkbox in
the status bar):** when the flag is on, the user is responsible for
*securely* deleting the checkpoint file (`shred`, `srm`, encrypted-volume
unmount, etc.) once it has served its purpose.  The core viewer does **not**
auto-delete, because it cannot know when "purpose fulfilled" is true from
the user's perspective, and an incorrect guess would either erase state
still needed for resumption or leave a forgotten file behind.

**Sibling repositories** in the Great Wall family will abstract this
complexity away from the user experience.  They wrap this core engine with:

- **Time-Lock-Puzzle (TLP) cryptographic gating** of intermediate states —
  so a leaked checkpoint file is not directly usable until its TLP solves,
  re-imposing a (smaller, but non-zero) time cost on the attacker even if
  the file is exfiltrated.
- **Automatic secure deletion** of intermediary derivation states once they
  are no longer needed by the workflow.

This core repository intentionally exposes the raw mechanism without those
ergonomic wrappers: it is the substrate those sibling tools build on, and
the explicit checkbox + status-bar warning make the trade-off impossible to
overlook for a developer or power user working directly with this engine.

### Decoding (select mode: 2 clicked points → 64 entropy bits, per stage)

Triggered by pressing **S** to enter select mode, then clicking 2 points on
the fractal viewport.  Select mode is **stage-aware**: in stage 1 it selects
S1/S2, in stage 2 it selects S3/S4.

For each click:
1. Screen pixel → f64 complex coordinate → raw i64 Fixed (the only lossy step).
2. `decode_full()` validates the point (checks it stays inside every
   contracted child) and returns 32 bits + leaf rect + validity flag.
3. The path prefix is advanced after each valid point (re-encode the decoded
   bits to derive the path).

After a stage's single point is fixed, its 32 bits join the cumulative prefix
that feeds the Argon2 derivation of the next stage's fractal. After the last
stage's point, the concatenated per-stage bits are combined →
`bits_to_mnemonic()` → full BIP39 phrase.

### Manual bit input mode

Press **M** to enter manual mode.  The user types bits directly:

- **O** key = bit 0 (left for vertical splits, up for horizontal)
- **I** key = bit 1 (right for vertical splits, down for horizontal)
- **Backspace** = undo last bit (crosses point boundary if needed)

Manual mode enforces **32 bits per stage** (one point).  After 32 bits, the
stage's point is auto-committed (path prefix advances) and the stage completes;
the user then runs the Argon2 step to unlock the next stage's fractal and
continues. Area visualization auto-enables and focuses on the latest bisection
step.

The status bar shows `P{stage} bit N/32` with the live path string.

### BIP39 phrase display and clipboard

The BIP39 text input field and Encode button are **only visible in debug mode**
(press **D** to toggle).  In normal mode, the panel shows the decoded
mnemonic status and a **Copy** button that copies the phrase to the system
clipboard (via `pygame.scrap` or `xclip`/`xsel`/`wl-copy` fallback).

### Critical constraints for lossless round-trip

1. **Same area, params, and path prefix.** Both encode and decode must use
   identical `ENCODE_AREA`, `GUI_PARAMS`, and path prefix.  Any mismatch
   causes the bisection trees to diverge, producing wrong bits.

2. **Raw i64 coordinates.** The encode path returns `point_re_raw` /
   `point_im_raw` as raw `i64` Fixed values. These are the *only*
   representation that guarantees lossless decode.

3. **Click precision.** When decoding by clicking, the screen→float→i64
   conversion must land inside the encoded point's leaf rectangle.  At the
   viewer's default zoom this is typically satisfied for points encoded with
   32 bits (leaf rectangles are much larger than a pixel).

### Render cache

The viewer optionally maintains a FIFO hash table cache (`--cache-size N`)
that stores `escape_count` results keyed on raw `(i64, i64)` Fixed
coordinates.  The cache is used exclusively by the rendering path
(`bs_render_viewport`) and has no effect on the deterministic
encode/decode bijection.  When panning at the same zoom level, most pixels
map to the same Fixed coordinates as the previous frame, yielding near-total
cache reuse and significantly faster re-renders.

## PointGen: Candidate Point Generation

Candidate points for island discovery are generated by `PointGen`, a
deterministic PRNG seeded from the fractal parameters and bisection path:

```
path_hash = splitmix64(path, rng_seed)
seed_lo   = wymix(wymix(o ^ s0, p ^ s1), wymix(q ^ s2, path_hash ^ s3))
seed_hi   = wymix(wymix(o ^ s4, q ^ s5), wymix(p ^ s6, path_hash ^ s7))
```

Both seed halves depend on **all four inputs** (o, p, q, path_hash) via
independent mixing orders with 8 distinct salt constants (from frac(e) bits
0–511). This ensures every input bit pseudorandomly affects both the Re and Im
coordinates of generated points.

Point generation is stateless:

```
re_raw = wymix(seed_lo ^ derive_salt_re, index)
im_raw = wymix(seed_hi ^ derive_salt_im, index)
re = area.re_min + (re_raw % re_range)     // [re_min, re_max)
im = area.im_min + (im_raw % im_range)     // [im_min, im_max)
```

---

## Point Validation in Selection Mode

When a user clicks a point on the fractal in selection mode, `decode_full`
runs the full 32-level bisection and checks whether the point survives
contraction at every level:

1. Run bisection (same as encoding) to determine which half the point falls in.
2. If the chosen half is the larger one, apply contraction.
3. Check `chosen.contains(point)` — if false, mark `valid = false`.
4. Repeat for all 32 levels.

Points that fail validation (fall in a contracted-away dead zone) are rejected
with a status bar message. Selection does not advance until a valid point is
clicked. This prevents accepting points that would decode to different bits
than expected.

---

## Per-Stage Parameter Derivation (Hash Byte Attribution)

Every point stage (index `k`, `1 ≤ k ≤ N`) derives its fractal parameters from
the memory-hard chain run over **stage-0 text followed by the concatenated bits
of all preceding points**:

```
digest_k = Argon2^N( stage-0 text  ‖  bits of points 1 .. k−1 )   // the memory-hard chain
h        = SHA-256(digest_k)
```

Stage-0 text is the ASCII bytes of the normalised `[A-Z0-9-]` label/pepper, so
stage 1 (`k = 1`, empty point prefix) already depends on it — which is exactly
why no fractal in the chain is the old public "canonical" surface.

The first 24 bytes of `h` are split into three 8-byte big-endian uint64 values
in **alphabetical order**:

```
o = h[0:8]       // orbit seed (z₀)
p = h[8:16]      // additive perturbation
q = h[16:24]     // linear perturbation (εz term)
```

Each parameter encodes a complex number with magnitude bits and sign bits:

| Param | Magnitude bits | Sign bits | Baseline | Min exponent |
|-------|---------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| o     | 31 per component | bit 31 (Re), bit 63 (Im) | none | 2^(-3) |
| p     | 31 per component | bit 31 (Re), bit 63 (Im) | 2^(-3) = 1/8 | 2^(-4) |
| q     | 31 per component | bit 31 (Re), bit 63 (Im) | none | 2^(-5) |

The byte-attribution and per-parameter encoding are unchanged from the earlier
prototype; what changed is the **input** to the chain (the cumulative prior
points) and that the derivation now runs **once per secret stage** rather than a
single time. The candidate *new* parameter families under study (history-
dependent folds, polynomial perturbations, bit-gated masks, …) are deliberately
**out of scope** for this protocol update and tracked separately in
`great-wall-docs/next-steps/research-notes-substrate-hardness.md`.

## Master-Secret Export (final Argon2id over the setup transcript)

A setup can export a **master secret** for blind hand-off (paste into another
wallet, derive a non-BIP39 seed, or act as the *pepper* of a downstream setup).
In `0.2.0` this carry-over was `SHA512(seedphrase ‖ text)`. As of `0.3.0` it is a
single **Argon2id** pass — built in the **same style as the inter-stage chain
(fixed salt `b"greatwall"`, with all per-setup uniqueness carried by the
message)** — over the **reproducible setup transcript**: the stage-0 input, the
iteration count, and, for every point stage *up to and including the exporting
stage* `k`, its derived parameters and the centre of its encoded point's leaf
rectangle, with the **exporting stage's own text input appended to the message**:

```
master = Argon2id(
    message = stage-0 text
              ‖ N_iter
              ‖ stage-1 params ‖ stage-1 leaf-centre (re, im)
              ‖ stage-2 params ‖ stage-2 leaf-centre (re, im)
              ‖ …
              ‖ stage-k params ‖ stage-k leaf-centre (re, im)
              ‖ stage-k text,    // EXPORTING stage's text (k ≥ 1), appended to
                                 //   the input; same [A-Z0-9-] restrictions
    salt    = b"greatwall",      // FIXED, same as the inter-stage chain
    type    = Argon2id,
    m       = 2^16 KiB  (65 536 KiB ≈ 64 MiB),
    p       = 2 threads,
    t       = 8 passes,
    l       = 1024 bytes of output
)
```

Each stage contributes its **params** (the `(o, p, q)` that defined its fractal)
and its **leaf-centre coordinates** (the raw I4F60 centre of the decoded point's
leaf rectangle), so the transcript is an exact, order-preserving function of the
setup so far and reproduces bit-for-bit on recovery.

**Stage-k text rides in the message; the salt is fixed.** This mirrors the
inter-stage chain, which also uses the fixed salt `b"greatwall"` and draws all of
its uniqueness from a high-entropy input (there, the memory-hard digest; here,
the per-setup transcript). The exporting stage's own text input (a non-0 stage,
not stage 0, subject to the same `[A-Z0-9-]` restrictions) is simply **appended
to the Argon2id message** rather than supplied as the salt. Two payoffs: the
construction is uniform with the rest of the protocol, and — because the label no
longer functions as a salt — **the Argon2 ≥ 8-byte salt minimum no longer
applies**, so a stage label may be any length (a bare `1` is fine; no padding or
pre-hashing is needed). Stage 0 stays free to play its chain-seeding salt/pepper
role.

**Available at every non-0 stage, not contingent on later stages.** The export
is offered at **all** non-0 stages (`k ≥ 1`), and producing it at stage `k`
does **not** require completing stages `k+1 .. N`. This is the convenience
primitive behind *amendable setups* (truncate-early / extend-later, see
`next-steps/chained-protocol-size-and-ux-roadmap.md` §4): a user may stop at any
stage boundary and carry over exactly the prefix fixed so far.

**Illustrative export labels (versioning).** Because each non-0 stage carries
its own label, the natural use is to **deterministically version keys per
usage**. Generic conventions (`[A-Z0-9-]`, same restrictions):

| Convention            | Example labels |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| Sequence (rotation #) | `1`, `2`, … (or zero-padded `00000001` for tidy sorting) |
| Date (`YYYY-MM-DD`)   | `2026-06-19` (issuance / rotation date) |
| Purpose-tagged        | `SIGNING-1`, `WITHDRAWAL-2026-06`, `AUDIT-2026-Q2`, `COSIGNER-03-OF-05` |
| Time-locked tranche   | `TRANCHE-UNLOCK-2030-01-01` |

Since the label rides in the Argon2id **message** (not the salt), there is **no
length minimum** — a bare `1` works; zero-padding (`00000001`) is now only a
cosmetic sorting convention, not a requirement.

**Why these parameters.** The export must tolerate **large outputs and large
peppers without entropy collapse** — feeding the 1024-byte result back in as a
downstream pepper must not narrow the space. Hence Argon2id (data-independent
first half resists side channels on a possibly-shared pepper, data-dependent
remainder keeps the memory gate), `m = 2^16 KiB` / `p = 2` / `t = 8` for a
modest but real cost on commodity hardware, and `l = 1024` so the output is
generous. **Excess output is simply ignored** — a consumer takes only as many
bytes as it needs.

**Output-size ergonomics (TODO).** 1024 bytes is unwieldy as a default. The
intended UX gates the **full 1024-byte output behind advanced options** and
shows a conventional **32 characters** (the **first 32**) by default. Building
that gating is **deferred** (this change set is already large): **for the time
being the export uses only the first 32 characters of the Argon2id output.**
Tracked in `next-steps/chained-protocol-size-and-ux-roadmap.md`.

## Compile-Time Logging

All diagnostic logging in the Rust engine uses the `log_verbose!` macro,
which compiles to nothing by default. To enable logging:

```bash
cargo build --release --features verbose
```

Without the feature flag, the compiler strips all logging code and the
variables used only for log formatting — zero runtime cost.
