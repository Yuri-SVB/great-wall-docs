## Why Great Wall?

Protecting a Bitcoin seed phrase is a problem with no good conventional
solution. Every existing approach sacrifices at least one desirable
property. Great Wall provides all four at once:

1. **Knowledge-Based Authentication.** Your secret lives entirely in your
   memory — no device, physical vault, or geographic location required.
2. **Individual Custody.** You depend on no one else. The core premise of
   Bitcoin — full self-custody — is kept intact.
3. **Non-Obscurity.** The method is not a secret trick that fails the
   moment an attacker learns about it. Nor does it rely on convincing the
   attacker that the stash doesn't exist or is smaller than it really is.
4. **Coercion-Resistance.** The threat of violence is ineffective as a
   means to obtain the secret leading to the stash.

> **In one sentence:** it's all in your head (1), in nobody else's (2),
> the attacker is aware of that (3), and is nevertheless unable to rob
> it (4).

This sounds like having your pie and eating it too — many times over. It
is only possible because the secret knowledge (that is only in your head)
is *tacit*, and the interface for *deploying* it (to convert it into a key)
is gated by an inescapably lengthy computation.

### How it works (the simple version)

The Burning Ship fractals are indescribable labyrinths. Great Wall converts
your secret into exact coordinates on these labyrinths.

Your memory of *where* those points are is **tacit knowledge** — the same
kind of knowledge that lets you recognize a friend's face but not describe
it precisely enough for a stranger to pick them out of a crowd. You can
identify your locations by looking at the fractal, but you literally
cannot dictate them to someone else. There is no verbal shortcut: the
only way to extract the secret is to sit in front of the fractal and
point.

Great Wall splits your secret into two halves. The first half is encoded
on the standard fractal. But before the second half can be encoded *or
decoded*, the system requires a long, memory-intensive computation using
Argon2 — a key-stretching algorithm where each step depends on the
previous one (strictly sequential) and requires gigabytes of RAM that
cannot be traded for speed. The delay is configurable: hours, days, or
weeks. The computation produces a unique key that reshapes the fractal
itself — generating a *new, private* labyrinth that only your
first-half secret can unlock.

The second-stage fractal **does not exist** until this computation
finishes. No one — not even a fully cooperative user — can reveal the
second-half locations any faster, because there is nothing to point at
until Argon2 is done.

This is why coercion fails: the user **cannot verbalize** their fractal
locations (tacit knowledge), and the second-stage fractal **cannot be
materialized** without completing the full Argon2 computation. Coercing
the user into giving up the entire secret effectively requires kidnapping
them for at least as long as the Argon2 delay — hours, days, or weeks.
That is the wall.

## Burning Ship Seed Encoder (`burning_ship/`)

Bijective mapping between BIP39 mnemonic seeds and locations in the
Burning Ship fractal, using I4F60 fixed-point arithmetic (60 fractional
bits, range [-8, +8)).

Supports three size presets:

| Preset  | BIP39 Words | Entropy Bits | Points/Stage |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| mini    | 6           | 64          | 1           |
| default | 12          | 128         | 2           |
| large   | 24          | 256         | 4           |

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (with cargo)
- Python 3.8+
- numpy >= 1.24
- pygame >= 2.5

### Build

```bash
cd burning_ship/rust_engine

# Release build (no logs — default)
cargo build --release

# Release build with verbose logging to stderr
cargo build --release --features verbose
```

This produces `burning_ship/rust_engine/target/release/libburning_ship_engine.so`.

### Run

```bash
cd burning_ship
python3 viewer.py

# Optional: enable render cache (recommended for smoother panning)
python3 viewer.py --cache-size 1048576
```

### Run tests

```bash
cd burning_ship

# All tests in one go (Rust + bijection + frozen vectors + round-trips + meta tests)
bash run_tests.sh
```

Or individually:

```bash
cd burning_ship

# Rust unit tests
cd rust_engine && cargo test && cd ..

# Bijection test (1-8 bits)
python3 test_bijection.py

# Frozen vectors, round-trips, cross-mode, and meta tests
python3 test_vectors.py

# Single vector (useful for debugging)
python3 test_vectors.py --vector test_vectors/v0.1.0/vanity2_iter0.json

# Verbose output (show diffs on failure)
python3 test_vectors.py --verbose
```

### Two-Stage Pipeline

**Stage 1** encodes the first half of entropy bits using the canonical
Burning Ship formula (o=0, p=0, q=0). The encoded bits are then hashed
with Argon2 (configurable profile and iteration count) to derive
stage-2 fractal parameters (o, p, q).

**Stage 2** encodes the remaining entropy bits using the perturbed
formula with the Argon2-derived parameters, producing a different
fractal with a different area tree.

### Argon2 Intermediate-State Checkpoints

Next to the Argon2 *Hash* button there is a **save intermediate**
checkbox. It is **off by default**.

- **Off (default):** the iterative Argon2 derivation is run from scratch
  and only the final digest is kept in memory. Nothing is written to
  disk. This preserves the wall-clock barrier — interrupting the
  computation forces a full restart, exactly as intended.
- **On:** every iteration's digest is appended to a checkpoint file
  (`.argon2_checkpoint_{input_hex}_{profile}.bin`) next to
  `argon2_pipeline.py`. On a subsequent run with the same input and
  profile, the highest saved iteration ≤ the target is used as the
  starting point. This is convenient for resuming after interruption,
  for trying nearby iteration counts when the exact target is
  forgotten, and for development.

> **Security note — your responsibility:** an intermediate-state file
> is precisely the artifact that lets an attacker skip the time cost
> Argon2 was meant to impose. **It is the user's responsibility to
> delete intermediate-state files (securely — e.g. `shred`, `srm`, or
> equivalent) once they have served their purpose.** Leaving them on
> disk defeats the entire point of the derivation. The core viewer
> deliberately does *not* auto-delete: it cannot know when "their
> purpose has been fulfilled" from the user's perspective, and a wrong
> guess would either delete state still needed for resumption or leave
> a forgotten file behind.

> **Sibling repositories** in the Great Wall family will abstract this
> complexity away from the UX. They wrap the core engine with

> and automatic secure deletion of intermediate derivation states once
> they are no longer needed — so end users don't have to manage

### Manual Bit-Input Mode

Press `M` to enter manual mode. Use `O` (bit 0) and `I` (bit 1) to
manually bisect the area tree one level at a time. The area visualization
updates incrementally (O(1) per keypress via inherited seeds across FFI).
Points auto-commit at 32 bits and advance to the next point.

### Point Selection & Validation

Press `S` to enter selection mode, then click points on the fractal.
Each clicked point is validated through the full bisection with
contraction — points that fall in contracted-away dead zones are
rejected with a status bar message.

Selection is **slot-based**: each click fills the *active slot*
(highlighted with a `←` next to its marker), and the active slot then
advances to the next still-empty slot. This means a wrong click is not
punitive — you can:

- Press `N` to cycle the active slot freely between any of the
  `points_per_stage` slots in the current stage, and
- Click again on a slot you already filled to **overwrite** it.

Once every slot in the stage holds a valid point, the bits are decoded
automatically and select mode exits.

### Salt & SHA512

When a BIP39 mnemonic is decoded, a salt input field and SHA512 button
appear. Enter a salt string and click SHA512 to compute
`SHA-512(mnemonic + salt)` — the hex digest is copied to the clipboard.

### Session Save/Load

Press `F6` to save the current session (encoded points, Argon2
parameters, mnemonic) to a JSON file. Press `F5` to load. The size
preset is auto-detected from the entropy bit count.

### Python API

```python
from burning_ship_engine import encode, decode, DiscoveryParams, Rect

bits = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
result = encode(bits)
decoded = decode(result.point_re_raw, result.point_im_raw, len(bits))
assert bits == decoded
```

### Precision Limits

With I4F60 (60 fractional bits), the encoder reliably handles **32 bits
per point**. For a 12-word BIP39 seed (128 entropy bits), use 2 stages
of 2 points each (32 bits per point). For 24-word (256 bits), use
2 stages of 4 points.
